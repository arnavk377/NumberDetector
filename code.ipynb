    "\n",
    "Given a set of images of football players, identify their jersey numbers from the images. The images are taken from various angles. The goal is to develop a model with a high accuracy that can detect a jersey number from an image taken from any angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "The main dataset I used is from here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/frlemarchand/nfl-player-numbers/data\n",
    "\n",
    "The full dataset contains about 43,500 64x64 images of NFL players with jersey numbers. The dataset appears to have some images where it is difficult, even for a human, to identify a player number. The images appear to come from All-22 film, with images from both the sideline and endzone view. \n",
    "\n",
    "I intend to use a randomly selected subset of images, as it is not feasible to upload all of these images to GitHub, and training a model on all of these images would be computationally expensive."
